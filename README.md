Just a little note for anyone regarding my Web Development journey. I began learning web development in 2020 when the pandemic happened and I took advantage of the lockdowns to begin pursuing something that I’ve had a passion for since I was a teenager. I worked through a bootcamp and earned my certificate for responsive web design and development through Cal Poly Pomona, and then it was suggested to me to learn digital marketing as well because it would be a good tool to have alongside development. I ended up going through another bootcamp to learn digital marketing, which led me to work with SEO due to my skills in development, and while I enjoyed the SEO work, it still wasn’t what I was passionate about, despite getting to update some things through WordPress, it wasn’t enough for me, and so after it seemingly feels like the course has run for SEO for me, I have made the exciting decision to truly pursue a full-time career in web development. Though I have experience from my previous projects and agency work, I know there is quite a bit I need to get refreshed and updated on, which is what I will be doing. If you want to see some of my previous projects, you can see them here( https://github.com/MikeCookDev ), and the newer work will be added here.
